Exploring the discord.py API by creating a bot. There are two databases that need to be created for the code to work locally: data/questions.db and data/reminders.db. There also needs to be data/serverprefixes.json. 

Will continue to add features as long as people in my server use it.

## TODO: 
1. [ ] Integrate [opentriviadb](https://opentdb.com/) to include some trivia problems as a game.
2. [X] Reminder functionality, which sends users DMs of reminders they set, storing the user's time zone and reminders in a local sqlite database.
3. [ ] Anilist integration using GraphQL queries to fetch data
4. [ ] Google images scraping
